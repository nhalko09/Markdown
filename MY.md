## Ingredients
To make the perfect sandwich, youâ€™ll need the following ingredients:

2 slices of fresh bread (whole wheat, sourdough, or your choice)
2-3 slices of your favorite deli meat (turkey, ham, or roast beef)
1-2 slices of cheese (cheddar, Swiss, or American)
Lettuce
Tomato slices
Pickles (optional)
Condiments (mustard, mayo, or aioli)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Bread**  
Start with two slices of fresh, soft bread. You can toast it for extra crunch if desired.

2. **Layer the Meat**  
Place the deli meat evenly on one slice of bread. Layer it generously, but don't overstuff.

3. **Add Cheese**  
Place the cheese on top of the meat. If you prefer melted cheese, you can toast the sandwich briefly.

4. **Add Fresh Veggies**  
Layer the lettuce, tomato, and pickles on top of the cheese for added freshness and crunch.

5. **Condiments**  
Spread your preferred condiment on the other slice of bread (mustard, mayo, or aioli are great options).

6. **Assemble the Sandwich**  
Place the second slice of bread on top, with the condiment side facing down.

7. **Cut and Serve**  
Cut your sandwich diagonally for a classic touch and serve with chips or a side of your choice.
